This pipeline was published recently (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36303799/) and could be useful in detecting variants in hard-to-map repetative regions of the _M.tuberculosis _genome_(e.g PPE, PE).
The original pipeline is available to download at https://genomics.icmr.org.in/softwares-and-tools/mycovarp. The original README file: https://genomics.icmr.org.in/images/MycoVarP/README.txt.gz
